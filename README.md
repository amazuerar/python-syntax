# Most common syntax elements in Python code:

This is a Python project aimed at understanding and identifying the most used syntax elements that occur in nowadays Python code (e.g. assignments, binary operation, if statements, function calls, lambdas, variables, etc.)

## 1. Data retrieval 

- Assesing [list](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/py150) of Python-based projects' repositories.
- Checking availability of repositories concerning Python projects, extracting and storing metadata.
- Understading the projects by performing exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics of collected information.
- Cloning relevant repositories according to the exploratory analysis.

## 2. Data processing

- Processing the files given a project, extracting the Abstract Syntax Trees ([AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#module-ast)) and performing frequency analysis of the syntax elements by Python file. 

## 3. Data analysis and visualization

- Merging syntax elements coming from the whole collection of Python-related repositories.
- Visualizing the data in order to provide a general overview of the most commong syntax elements.

## 4. Data

- Sharing MongoDB Collection as JSON and CVS files. The files are composed of Python-based projects metadata which were employed in this challenge.
